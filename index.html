        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Semantic HTML provides many benefits to people, devices, and software reading our HTML documents, and how
            they're able to comprehend them.</p>
        How to apply Semantic HTML to a document
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Start by pasting just the text of the content into the body of a new HTML document</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Determine the major components of your content</p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Main Header</strong> - What is your heading content?</li>
                <li><strong>Main</strong> - What is the main content?</li>
                <li><strong>Aside</strong> - This may be optional, but do you have content that doesn't fit in the main
                    area, but is still relevant?</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation</strong> - Do you have irrelevant content in your document that belong on another
                    page?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <p>Once you determined the major components, determine if there are any sub-components</p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>For the main header, what is your major title? Do you have any slogans, tags, or phrases you want to
                    identify? Do you have a logo, an image, or an illustration you want to head your document?</li>
                <li>For the main portion of your document, what is largest body of content that encapsulates an idea or
                    concept? Does it break down into paragraphs? Does it need sub sections to break the content down
                    even further. Do you need to organizational components such as figures, lists, or tables, or perhaps
                    interactive components like forms?</li>
                <li>The aside is intended for relevant content but that doesn't necessarily fit directly into the main
                    idea. This can be broken down just like the main section; you can determine if you require headings,
                    sub sections, organizational structures, or even interactive components</li>
                <li>The navigation needs to be a collection of links, and how they're structured has been argued since
                    the dawn of HTML 5. My personal preference is to use the nav tag and encapsulate a list of links
                    pointing to content pieces that are not relevant to the current document</li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                <p>Now that you have your sub components, review your content and see if any further semantic tweaking
                    could help refine your content and provide more meaning</p>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you have any content that requires emphasis?</li>
                <li>Do you have quoted content, that needs citation?</li>
                <li>Do you want to quote content that you have in the same document?</li>
                <li>Do you want to stress the importance behind some content?</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Structural, semantic HTML is the key starting point toward good accessibility practices.</p>
                <p>When a screen reader, or any sort of assistive device scans a web page, it gets information about the
                    Document Object Model (DOM), or the HTML structure of the page. No styles or JavaScript will be read
                    by a screen reader.</p>

        <h2>Structured HTML and Semantic HTML Fall Hand-in-Hand</h2>
        <p>Structured HTML is the practice of formatting the HTML in the correct order of intended digestion. This means,
            that the content is organized in the order it was expected to be read.</p>
